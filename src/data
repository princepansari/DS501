[["Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database systems, human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, bioinformatics and theory of computing. ", "Computer science is the study of algorithmic processes, computational machines and computation itself.[1] As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms, computation and information to the practical issues of implementing computational systems in hardware and software.[2][3]\nIts fields can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines. For example, the theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them, while computer graphics or computational geometry emphasize more specific applications. Algorithms and data structures have been called the heart of computer science.[4] Programming language theory considers approaches to the description of computational processes, while computer programming involves the use of them to create complex systems. Computer architecture describes construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. Artificial intelligence aims to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. A digital computer is capable of simulating various information processes.[5] The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.[6] Computer scientists usually focus on academic research. The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer sciences.\n", "Theoretical computer science (TCS) is a subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on mathematical aspects of computer science such as the theory of computation, lambda calculus, and type theory.\nIt is difficult to circumscribe the theoretical areas precisely. The ACM's Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT) provides the following description:[1]\n"], ["Shiksha summarises a list of IITs in India along with their MHRD-NIRF 2020 ranking, BTech seat intake, number of B.Tech courses offered, and links to important information such as cut offs, placements, admission proccess & course fees.List of Top Ranking IITs", "Shiksha summarises a list of IITs in India along with their MHRD-NIRF 2020 ranking, BTech seat intake, number of B.Tech courses offered, and links to important information such as cut offs, placements, admission proccess & course fees.List of Top Ranking IITs", "The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are the premier autonomous public technical and research universities located across India.[1] They are governed by the Institutes of Technology Act, 1961, which has declared them as Institutes of National Importance and lays down their powers, duties, and framework for governance.[2][3] The Institutes of Technology Act, 1961 lists twenty-three institutes.[4] Each IIT is autonomous, linked to the others through a common council (IIT Council), which oversees their administration. The Minister of Education is the ex officio Chairperson of the IIT Council.[5] As of 2020[update], the total number of seats for undergraduate programs in all IITs is 16,053.[6]\nThe history of the IIT system dates back to 1946 when Sir Jogendra Singh of the Viceroy's Executive Council set up a committee whose task was to consider the creation of Higher Technical Institutions for post-war industrial development in India. The 22-member committee, headed by Nalini Ranjan Sarkar, recommended the establishment of these institutions in various parts of India, along the lines of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with affiliated secondary institutions.[17]\n"], ["\n\nThere are 28 districts in the state of Chhattisgarh, which has a total population 25,540,196 as of 2011.
