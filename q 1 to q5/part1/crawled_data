For example, the theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them, while computer graphics or computational geometry emphasize more specific applications. Algorithms and data structures have been called the heart of computer science.[4] Programming language theory considers approaches to the description of computational processes, while computer programming involves the use of them to create complex systems. Computer architecture describes construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment. Artificial intelligence aims to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. A digital computer is capable of simulating various information processes.[5] The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.[6] Computer scientists usually focus on academic research. The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer sciences.\n"

Courses usually include introduction to programming, introduction to algorithms and data structures, computer architecture, operating systems, computer networks, parallel computing, embedded systems, algorithms design, circuit analysis and electronics, digital logic and processor design, computer graphics, scientific computing, software engineering, database systems, digital signal processing, virtualization, computer simulations and games programming. CSE programs also include core subjects of theoretical computer science such as theory of computation, numerical methods, machine learning, programming theory and paradigms. Modern academic programs also cover emerging computing fields like image processing, data science, robotics, bio-inspired computing, computational biology, autonomic computing and artificial intelligence.[1] Most of the above CSE areas require initial mathematical knowledge, hence the first year of study is dominated by mathematical courses, primarily discrete mathematics, mathematical analysis, linear algebra and statistics, as well as the basics of physics - field theory and electromagnetism.\n"

Nehru, being an enthusiast and patron of science, was clear that science and technology had a prominent role to play in modernizing India and meeting the needs of its growing population.

Covering an area of 1.35 Lac Sq Km, Chhattisgarh can broadly be divided into Central plains drained by Mahanadi and Sheonath Rivers, the picturesque Norther Plateau and the enchanting Bastar Plateau. With more than 45% forest cover, Chhattisgarh provides a unique milieu of Tribal culture/ values which have blended seamless with subsequent waves of people who have come to call this place as their home. Strategically located at the \u2018heart\u2019 of India, Chhattisgarh has had influence of all North and South, as well as East and West. This lends a cosmopolitan culture with high value attached to personal independence, women empowerment etc.The gender ratio for Chhattisgarh according to the 2011 census was 991, Chhattisgarh has a high female-male sex ratio (991)[39] ranking at the 5th position among other states of India. Although this ratio is small compared to other states, it is unique in India because Chhattisharh is \u2014 the 10th largest state in India. The gender ratio in Rural areas is 1000, but the urban gender ratio, on the other hand is very low at just 917. The trend of a very low urban gender ratio is common across different groups in Chhattisgarh. The gender ratio amongst the tribal groups in the state, based on the 1991 census was 1009, but it falls to a low of just 920 for urban areas. Similarly the gender ratio for all scheduled castes was 987, whereas it was 853 in urban areas. It is not only the tribal communities that have a high gender ratio. The non-scheduled tribes and castes have a gender ratio of 971 in 1991. This figure is high and shows that women in Chhattisgarh are in a better condition in comparison to most of India."
